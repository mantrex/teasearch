# Custom Field

Dynamic custom field types with extensive widget and formatter plugin support. 
A highly performant & scalable alternative to paragraphs and entity reference by
storing data in a single table.

## Features

- Multiple-value fields without entity references
- Inline field widgets using a customizable css-flexbox-based layout system
- Multiple field formatters: CustomField (custom theme hook), Inline, HTML List,
  Table, Custom Template (similar to views' field rewrite functionality)
- Clone field settings from **ANY** entity type
- Add/Remove columns to fields with existing data.
  [See documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/contributed-modules/contributed-module-documentation/custom-field/addremove-columns-to-custom-fields-with-existing-data)
- Performance & scalability - Eliminates unnecessary field table bloat and 
  configuration files
- Reduce overhead - May replace the need for additional contrib modules

## Why this module?

In some cases, Drupal's field api for single value fields is overkill for
storing simple field data that would be better to consolidate in a single table.
One *Custom Field* can contain many columns in a single table which can lead to
a substantial boost in performance by eliminating unnecessary joins and allowing
for simpler configuration management.

## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
