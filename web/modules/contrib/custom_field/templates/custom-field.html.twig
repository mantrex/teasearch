 * Default theme template for custom fields.
 *
 * To override output, copy the "custom-field.html.twig" from the templates directory
 * to your theme's directory and customize it, just like customizing other
 * Drupal templates such as page.html.twig or node.html.twig.
 *
 * Instead of overriding the theming for all fields, you can also just override
 * theming for a subset of fields using
 * @link themeable Theme hook suggestions. @endlink For example,
 * here are some theme hook suggestions that can be used for a field_foo field
 * on an article node type:
 * - custom-field--field-my-field-name.html.twig
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - items: An array of custom field items.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 * - field_name: The name of the field.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_custom_field()
